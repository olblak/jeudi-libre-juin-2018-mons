= Your First Pipeline

== Blue Ocean

* We want to create a Pipeline from scratch using Blue Ocean.
* Browse to your Jenkins instance and switch to Blue Ocean:
** Click on the item "Open Blue Ocean", on the left menu
** _Or_ link:{jenkins-url}/blue[Direct link to Blue Ocean GUI,window=_blank]

== Follow along: Initialize Your First Pipeline 1/4

* Follow the presenter instructions to create a new Pipeline:
** Stored in *Git*
** Get the *SSH* URL from the _git server_
*** `{demoapp-repo-git-url}`
** Jenkins is *already* allowed to access the source code:
*** Nothing to do for SSH Key

== Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor

* Provides a Pipeline's graphical editor in Blue Ocean,
with full round trip with SCM:
** Scaffold your Pipeline, Save it, Execute it.
* Supports existing Declarative Pipeline,
as starting from scratch
* Requires a compatible SCM (Git over SSH, Github, BitBucket, etc.)

== Follow along: Initialize Your First Pipeline 2/4

* Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`
** It opens automatically the *Pipeline Editor* for you

* A red message appears saying: "a stage is needed":
** Create a stage named *Build* by clicking the big "+"

* Each stage (virtual) is composed of "steps" (implementation)
** "At least one step is required"

== Follow along: Initialize Your First Pipeline 3/4

* We want the stage *Build* to have 2 steps:
** Print the message `Building...`
** Execute the shell script `./scripts/build.sh`

* Time to run this Pipeline: click the "Save" button
** Add a meaningful Description (commit message)
** Commit to 'master'
** Clic Save & Run, and see the build kicking off

== Follow-along: Initialize Your First Pipeline 4/4

* Take time to browse the build page in Blue Ocean
** Click on the stage, unfold the logs...

* Click the "Edit" (pen) button to go back to the editor,
and use `CTRL + S` (On Mac: `CMD + S`),
to switch to textual description:

== Exercise: Add 2 New Stages to your First Pipeline

* Goal: add 2 new stages to your Pipeline:
*Integration Tests*::
runs the script `./scripts/integration-tests.sh`

*Deploy*::
runs the script `./scripts/deploy.sh`

* Use the *Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor*:
** Click on the "Edit" button (pen's icon)
** Use the *Build* stage as example

== Solution: Add 2 New Stages to your First Pipeline

* Check the file `Jenkinsfile` into the SCM (*Gitea Git Server*)
