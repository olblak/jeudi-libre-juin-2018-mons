= Dockerized Agent for Docker in Docker

== Architecture

----
* node
|_ docker daemon
   |_ jenkins agent <- privileged container
   |_ docker client -----
   |_ docker daemon  <--|
----

* 'docker' command is called from a dockerized jenkins

* link:https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/[Docker Hub]

== Limitations

* Depends on Docker Daemon configuration and filesystem used
** Require '--privileged' to disable Linux Security Modules
Like AppArmor(Outer)/Selinux(Inner docker)
** Inner/Outer Docker filesystem compatibility (AUFS on AUFS doesn't work)
** Storage Driver, outer Docker run on normal FS and inner docker on a copy-on-write system

== Jenkinsfile

----
pipeline {
 agent any
 stages {
   stage('Build and Publish') {
     steps {
       scm
       sh 'docker build -t my_image .'
       sh 'docker push my_image'
     }
   }
 }
}
----

== Evaluation Criteria

* Security?  Bad
* Simplicity?  Good
* Speed:  
** Dynamic Agent? Bad
** Static Agent? Good
* Resource Efficiency? Bad
