= Pipeline: Tests and Webhooks

== Follow-along: Test Reports with JUnit 1/3

* We want to report test results to Jenkins
* Let's start with Unit Test's results:
** They are in "Junit" format,
generated during the *Build* stage
** XML files located in:
+
[source,bash]
----
target/surefire-reports/
----

** Jenkins's "Junit" plugin is installed by default

== Follow-along: Test Reports with JUnit 2/3

* Open the Pipeline in *Blue Ocean Editor*
* Edit the stage *Build*
* Remove the _Print Message_ step
* Add a new _Archive JUnit-formatted test results_ step
** Set the field *TestResults* to `target/surefire-reports/{asterisk}.xml`
* Save the pipeline and check the build

== Follow-along: Test Reports with JUnit 3/3

* When the build finished, check the "Tests" section
* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/03-Jenkinsfile-unit-tests.groovy[]
----

== Exercise: Integration Tests Report

* We also want the integration test's reports
** Generated during the *Integration Tests* stage
** Still using JUnit, but XML files
are generated in:
+
[source,bash]
----
target/failsafe-reports/
----

* Expected status of the build: *UNSTABLE*

== Solution: Integration Tests Report

* What are the changes between *UNSTABLE* and *SUCCESS*?
** Color, Test failure notification badge, etc.

* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/04-Jenkinsfile-all-tests.groovy[]
----

== Continuous Integration (CI)

image::{imagedir}/fail-fast-continuous-integration.png[height=200]

* Each code integration is validated by an *automated build*
* Code is integrated *often*, at least daily, to be a non-event
* Feedback loop to close the continous cycle

== Faster Feedbacks using Webhooks

* We want builds to start when:
** A Pipeline is saved from Blue Ocean => OK
** New code is added in the SCM => ??

* A "Webhooks" is already configured:
** _When_ new code is added into the SCM,
** _Then_ the SCM server sends a request to notify the event
** _And_ Jenkins reacts to this event by indexing the repository,
and eventually starts new builds

== Exercise: Fix the build

* We are doing Continous Integration!
** The build *MUST* be fixed as *top* priority

* Identify the name of the failing test
** TIP: Use Blue Ocean's "Test" tab

* Use the SCM (the *Gitea Web UI*) to edit the code
** Tests are stored into `src/test/java/hello/`
** Each time the code is changed, a build is started

== Solution: Fix the build

* From
link:{demoapp-repo-web-url}/src/master/src/test/java/hello/HelloControllerIT.java[src/test/java/hello/HelloControllerIT.java]
** Click on "Edit"
* Comment the line 39
* *Un*-comment the line 40
* *Commit* with the right message
* The started build must be green again
