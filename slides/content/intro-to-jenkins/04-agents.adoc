= Agents

== What is an Agent?

* A process running on a remote *node*,
ready to execute tasks on behalf of the Jenkins master
** Formerly known as _slave_

== Benefits of Agents

* Specific Agent Roles:
** Custom operating system (Windows, Linux)
** Specialized hardware (Macs, Solaris, Arm CPUs, etc.)

* Horizontal Scalability of builds
** More builds? More machines!

* Diminution of "Blast Radius"
** An agent goes down? Another takes the load
** Jenkins Master goes down (OOM, Restart): no impact

== Agent and Pipeline

* A pipeline's build is executed on an *agent*
** The keyword `agent` must be specified

* Some stages can be executed on *different* agents:
** E.g. Build on Linux, Test on Linux and Windows
** The keyword `agent` can be specified per stage

== Follow-along: Specify Agent for our Pipeline 1/2

* Edit the Pipeline with the Blue Ocean Editor

* Access the "Pipeline Settings" on the right section
** TIP: If not visible, click on the "Start" node

* Change the agent `any` to a *node* with the label `maven3-jdk8`
** "any" was picking randomly an available agent
** Note the other options

* Save and run the Pipeline

== Follow-along: Specify Agent for our Pipeline 2/2

* Search for occurrences of `"Running on"` in the Pipeline's log
** The file `pipeline.log` can be found in "Artifacts"
* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/05-Jenkinsfile-global-agent.groovy[]
----

== Exercise: Execute Deploy stage in "production"

* Goal: the Stage *Deploy* has to be run in (fake) "production"
* Tools: there is an agent with the label "production"
* Change the Pipeline to have only the *Deploy* stage
running on this agent

== Solution: Execute Deploy stage in "production"

* Validate using the occurrences of `Running on` in the `pipeline.log`
* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/06-Jenkinsfile-deploy-agent.groovy[]
----

== Reusing Binary: Challenge

* Pipeline efficiency and security rule:
build once, fingerprint and then reuse

* Challenge: workspace is *NOT* shared across agents.
** A new workspace is allocated for *each* stage


== Reusing Binary: Solution

* Pipeline can store artifacts from stage to stage
** Assumption: building a binary is 1 order of magnitude slower
than copying it on the network

* Two types of artifact storages, both using a copy-to-master:
** Permanent storage with `archiveArtifacts`.
** Ephemeral storage with `stash` (and `unstash`),
deletion when the build stops.

== Follow-along: Reuse Jar File 1/3

* Goal: we want the stages *Integration Test* and *Deploy* to reuse
the folder `target` generated during the stage *Build*

== Follow-along: Reuse Jar File 2/3

* Edit the stage *Build* and add a new step:
** Type of the new step: "Stash some files to be used later in the build"
** Name: `generated-artifacts`
** Include: `target/**/*` (the folder `target/` and all its content)

* For both *Integration Tests* and *Deploy* stages:
** Add a new step of type "Restore files previously stashed"
** Set the Name to `generated-artifacts`
** Move these steps at the *beginning* of each stage

== Follow-along: Reuse Jar File 3/3

* Validate using the logs of the *Deploy* stage (comparing with previous builds)
* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/07-Jenkinsfile-stash-unstash.groovy[]
----

== Exercise: Parallel Integration Tests

* Goal: Run Integration Tests for both Java 9 and 8
* Tools: you have 2 available "java" agents
with the respective labels `jdk9` and `jdk8`
* Edit the Pipeline to execute, in *parallel*,
the integration tests on each of these agents
** Keep the stage *Integration Tests* as parent stage
** Name the "sub-stages" *IT Java 9* and *IT Java 8*
** Don't forget to unstash from *Build* and to publish test reports.

== Solution: Parallel Integration Tests

* Validate using Test reports (compared to previous builds), and build logs
* Let's have a look to the expected Pipeline:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
include::{pipeline-solutions}/08-Jenkinsfile-parallel.groovy[]
