== Jenkins Pipelines

image::{imagedir}/pipeline.jpg[height=200]

* A tool to express your software pipeline with a DSL
* Defined into a text file: `Jenkinsfile`
* "Pipeline-as-code": stored into your SCM
* != "Job DSL" (different areas)

== Benefits of Jenkins Pipelines

* Follows from your code workflows: branches, pull request,
code review, even trunk-based
* Reduces the number of jobs
* A single execution ("build") can run on multiple machines
* Durable: survives a Jenkins restart
